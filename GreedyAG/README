How to use:

1) Run GreedyAG.mw
2) Pick minimal problem (prob := "problem_name")
3) Configure options (please see comments in GreedyAG.mw)
4) Start genTemplate(prob, opts);


Folders:

1) "problems" - minimal problem formulations
2) "cm" - pre-computed in Macaulay2 change matrices for all Grobner bases generated by GBfan
3) "nongb" - pre-computed non-standard quotient space bases
4) "optim" - best template data produced by the generator
