# EliminationTemplates
Elimination template generators for solving polynomial systems and related problems and solvers in geometric computer vision

Folders:

1) _GreedyAG: automatic generator by greedy parameter search
2) _RedundantAG: automatic generator by redundant solving bases and Laurent monomials
3) problems: minimal problem formulations (some formulations were adapted from http://people.inf.ethz.ch/vlarsson/misc/autogen_v0_5.zip)
4) solvers: collection of state-of-the-art solvers
