Each problem folder contains at least 5 m-files:

1) inidata_prob: generates random initial data
2) coefs_prob: computes initial Macaulay (coefficient) matrix
3) (n)std_prob(_colpiv): the solver (std/nstd - standard/non-standard quotient space basis, colpiv - column-pivoting strategy)
4) test_num_prob: evaluates speed and numerical accuracy of the solver
5) histo_num_prob: plots numerical error histogram

Some problem folders contain 2 additional m-files:

6) inidata_feas_prob: generates initial data from a random synthetic scene
7) test_feas_prob: evaluates relative errors in feasible quantities such as focal lengths and/or radial distortion coefficients
