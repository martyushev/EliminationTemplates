Each problem folder contains at least 5 m-files:

1) inidata_num_prob: generates random initial data
2) coefs_prob: computes initial Macaulay (coefficient) matrix
3) (n)std_mxn(_colpiv)_prob: the solver generated by greedyAG (std/nstd - standard/non-standard quotient space basis, m x n - template size, colpiv - if column-pivoting strategy used)
4) red_mxn(_colpiv)_prob: the solver generated by redundantAG (m x n - template size, colpiv - if column-pivoting strategy used)
5) test_num_prob: evaluates speed and numerical accuracy of the solver

Some problem folders contain additional m-files, e.g.

6) inidata_feas_prob: generates initial data from a random synthetic scene
7) test_feas_prob: evaluates relative errors in feasible quantities such as focal lengths and/or radial distortion coefficients
